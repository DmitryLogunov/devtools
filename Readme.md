## DEVTOOLS - the set of tools for developing software using microservices architecture

### The supported stack of techologies

- The main platform for microservices: Node.js
- Programming language: Typescript 
- Deploying via Kubernetes & Helm

### Requirements

- Python3
- Pip

```
  pip install pyYaml
  pip install DateTime
```

### Commands

- **build**

  The command provides doing some operations with the set of services:

    - building and refreshing the service dependencies (in the folder /node_modules)
    - building and refreshing JS code from typescript (starting tsc builder)
    - building docker images
    - pushing docker images to the docker registry


  All operations can be applied to any sets of services (there are agile tools for filtering services for building the sets of services). 
  All operations are optional. The scenario of executed operations are agilly defined by flags.

- **deploy**

  The command provides deploying the some set of services to kubernetes cluster. 
        
  As optional this command can refresh Helm values file (values.yaml) if it's need. 
  The result file values.yaml is saved in the folder of current release 
  (./releases/<current-release-name>/values.yml) and applied in the process of deploying.
        
  There are the agily set of tools for managing of current release setting with using the scpecial configuration 
  in YAML file ./releases/<current-release-name>/release.yml 
  (see the example in folder ./releases/<release-example>/release.yml) 
  All values from ./releases/<current-release-name>/release.yml merges with the current values 
  file in ./releases/<current-release-name>/values.yml

- **exec**

  Attaches to the some service which executes in some pod of kubernetes cluster and starts console (/bin/sh)

- **get-pod**

  Prints out the pod ID of some service which executes in some pod of kubernetes cluster

- **logs**

  Prints out the logs from STDOUT of some service which executes in some pod of kubernetes cluster

- **port-forward**

  Forwards PORT of some service which executes in some pod of kubernetes cluster to the local machine PORT

- **refresh-aws-access**

  Authorizates in the AWS docker registry, builds the kubernetes dockerconfig secret
  and refreshes docerconfig tocken in the file ./configuration/devlab.aws.dockerconfig
  
  IMPORTANT NOTICE: for using this command you should have an access to AWS registry.
  If you have not access to AWS registry ask it for AWS registry administrator.
  The AWS credentials should be stored in the file ~/.aws/credentials

- **run-tests**

  Runs unit tests for the some set of services and prints out the summary resluts.
  There are agile tools for filtering services for building the sets of services.

- **show-process**

  Prints out the information about the service which is executed on some tcp PORT
